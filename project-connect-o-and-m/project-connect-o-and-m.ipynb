    "# Project Connect O&M\n",
    "\n",
    "On October 30th, Project Connect provided a joint meeting of the Austin City Council and its Board of Directors two memos estimating the operations and maintenance (O&M) costs for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) modes serving the alignments commonly referred to as the \"Orange\" and \"Blue\" Lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis examines the *revenue hour* cost estimates in those memos, as they are the foundation of the overall O&M cost estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main findings: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Project Connect's BRT revenue hour cost estimate is lower than the national average by 26%. Project Connect does not explain its rationale for the methodological choices that lead to the lower rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project Connect's use of a *flat* passenger car revenue hour rate to calculate LRT costs obfuscates the economies of scale associated with multi-car LRT trains. This is a change from the approach taken by Project Connect in 2013-2014. The new method makes Blue Line LRT appear more productive and Orange Line LRT less productive than an approach that recognizes the cost advantages of LRT scale (e.g. multi-car trains). Project Connect does not explain the rationale for the methodological switch or why its current approach will generate more accurate estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion to this analysis provides several recommendations for Project Connect personnel, as well as local media, and activists.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide transparency and clarity about the data and methods used, this analysis is presented as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). This format allows for Project Connect vendors, local media, and activists to easily edit, correct, or extend the analysis."

    "## BRT O&M\n",
    "\n",
    "The main finding of this review of Project Connect's BRT O&M calculations is that its BRT revenue hour figure is **lower** when compared to the average of the BRT implementations reported in the National Transit Database (NTD).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Connect's BRT Revenue Hour\n",
    "\n",
    "On page 15 of the October 30th Orange Line O&M memo, Project Connect provides this explanation of their cost estimation methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unit costs are given in 2028 dollars, reflecting the anticipated opening date for the Orange Line, and are escalated 3% annually for estimates associated with the 2040 ridership forecast year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language on the Orange Line memo leaves the question of whether the batch of 2028 estimates within it are also inflated at the annual 3%. The Blue Line O&M memo is, thankfully, worded in a clearer fashion. Its page 13 explanation removes the doubt:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cost calculations are mode-specific and presented in 2028 dollars reflecting the anticipated opening year for the Blue Line Corridor. Unit costs were inflated at three percent annually to 2040. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the 3% annual cost inflation constant, the Orange and Blue Line memos provide the following details about the BRT revenue hour figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    For new bus and BRT services not covered by the contract, a unit cost of $156.93 per revenue hour (2028) is used as a fully allocated cost (including fuel and general administration). For BRT, an additional cost factor for guideway maintenance is added to the cost per revenue hour. Based on National Transit Database information, an adjustment of $30,000 per directional guideway mile was applied to street-level guideway options. For mixed and elevated guideway options, an annual cost of $80,000 per directional guideway mile was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language implies that the Project Connect team is using a current, contractually-negotiated set of numbers for the three expense categories the 2018 and 2019 NTD Full Reporting Policy Manuals label as \"vehicle operations\", \"vehicle maintenance\", and \"general administration\". And then Project Connect switches to using NTD products to figure out the guideway maintenance, which is typically included under the NTD operating expense reporting category labeled as \"non-vehicle maintenance\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it is not clear what method was used to calculate the $156.93 number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Orange Line memo includes a set of tables under Appendix A on page 16. The 2028 O&M Cost Calculations in that table report the vehicle revenue hours and total annual operating expenses under two guideway options. The figures are 173,000 revenue hours and $30,249,000 cost for the elevated option. It's 148,000 revenue hours and $24,399,000 cost for the surface option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the actual 2028 revenue hour cost including the guideway maintenance.\n"

    "There might be unforeseen vehicle and non-vehicle maintenance costs when true BRT is used at levels not presently experienced by CapMetro. Simply asserting a revenue hour estimate without establishing its validity undermines quality decision-making by policymakers."

    "The main finding of this review of Project Connect's LRT O&M calculations is that it obscures the scaling advantages of LRT. \n",
    "\n",
    "This undermines the productivity of Orange Line LRT, while inflating that of Blue Line LRT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Connect's LRT Revenue Hour\n",
    "\n",
    "On page 15 of the October 30th Orange Line O&M memo, Project Connect provides the following explanation for their LRT revenue hour cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "    O&M unit costs for LRT service reflect a weighted national average cost per revenue hour of $393.33 (2028, adjusted from $284.15 2017 NTD). This includes guideway maintenance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Blue Line LRT estimates use the same method. The 3% annual inflation constant is also used.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important decision that Project Connect's new methodology makes is that it views each passenger car in a train as a \"vehicle\" with a fixed cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the third car on the train costs as much as the first one. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the 2013-14 version of Project Connect, its vendors used a [different methodology](http://keepaustinwonky.org) that recognized fixed system costs, train costs, and passenger car costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss this choice and its implications in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NTD's LRT Revenue Hour\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the $284.15 revenue hour cost for 2017 correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "To check Project Connect's number, we will use the available 2017 LRT data from the NTD. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we transform the 2017 operating expense and service data Excel spreadsheets accessible by the [NTD Data Reports download page](http://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/ntd-data) into easier to consume CSV files accessible through this site.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already loaded the necessary data to conduct the above BRT analysis, so we query to select only the data for operating LRT modes, and then do the same data cleanup and merging as we did with the BRT section above. "

    "### Train vs. Car\n",
    "\n",
    "NTD's Full Reporting Policy Manuals and its actual database make a distinction between a light rail *train* revenue hour and a passenger *car* revenue hour. As explained above, a train can have one or more cars. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why would NTD collect car *and* train data if a flat passenger car revenue hour is the superior budgeting metric, as Project Connect assumes in its October 30th O&M memos? Why would they track train hours?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons, but one of them is the perceived scaling advantage of light rail. From an O&M perspective, a common perception shared by some industry professionals and transit advocates is that the fixed expenses associated with fielding a train with one car (e.g. the train operator) can be shared by additional cars. The implication is that the cost of serving an additional rail customer with light rail keeps going down as passenger cars are added. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is different than BRT, which must field an additional vehicle with, for example, an additional driver. With BRT, the \"train\" always has one \"car\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So, are the perceived advantages of rail at scale real or is it just theory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into this question by loading a new data set that includes *train* revenue hours. In this data set, an individual agency can have data associated with the light rail services it directly operates (\"DO\" service type) or that it pays for and does not directly operate (\"PT\" service type).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll do some cleanup on the column names and drop the Hudson-Bergen light rail as it is an outlier data point with a much, much higher cost structure and it is not directly operated by a transit agency. And we'll merge the new train data with the already loaded agency operating expense data. We also mark the peer cities discussed above with a [dummy variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)).\n",
    "\n",
    "After some basic calculations, there are four new columns for each agency's service implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Extra Car Revenue Hours* finds the difference between train revenue hours and vehicle revenue hours, which indicates the count of revenue hours produced by the cars operated in addition to the first train car. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *Load Factor* divides the total vehicle revenue hours by the train revenue hours; this helps us determine the average number of cars for a train.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Train RevHr Opex* divides the total 2017 operating expenses by *train* revenue hours. This provides an estimate of what the average LRT train costs to run for each agency service type.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Car RevHr Opex* divides the total 2017 operating expenses by vehicle revenue hours. A \"vehicle\" is a passenger car according to the NTD reporting manual. This column reports the average LRT car costs to run for each agency service type. \n",
    "\n",

    "If rail does indeed have scale advantages, then we would expect that the car revenue hour cost for systems with high load factors would tend to be lower. Certainly, regional variations in labor policy and business costs, along with other complicating factors such as geography, will also contribute to the variation in car revenue hours costs. But give that cost-competitiveness at scale is an oft-cited advantage of light rail, one would still expect additional cars to be more cost effective as trains get longer.\n",

    "One challenge that the Project Connect team likely faced when deciding on an O&M cost calculation methodology was how to split costs between fixed operating system expenses that have to be paid before even the first train runs, the expenses for the first car of a train, and the expenses of each additional train car. By opting for a flat per car revenue hour measure, this discussion was simplified for policymakers. Unfortunately, as the national LRT vehicle revenue hour coefficient of variation demonstrates, the flat rate method would miss the actual reported rates for most systems by substantial amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To arrive at a less risky O&M cost estimate with more nuanced cost allocation, we'll use [ordinary least squares linear regression](http://setosa.io/ev/ordinary-least-squares-regression/) as an exploratory tool in finding a more accurate cost distribution. The dependent variable (i.e. the outcome) in the regression will be the total operating expense for each agency LRT service type. We will use train revenue hours, extra car revenue hours, and the peer dummy variable as the independent variables (i.e. the outcome drivers)."

That previous methodology also selected a set of peer cities (Seattle, Charlotte, Minneapolis, Houston, Phoenix, Hampton Road) instead of the entire national sample. Interestingly enough, the share of total opex that was assigned to passenger car-specific expenses under that model was 19%. Compare that to how the regression results price the extra passenger car revenue hour rate at 23% of the first-car train setup. The similarity is worth noting. And it would be valuable for present-day Project Connect to explain why its flat rate is a superior approach than the 2013-2014 technique.\n",
